* July 2019

This is a very basic game of brick, written just to experiment with the canvas element. Live demo at: https://rawcdn.githack.com/douglas-watson/canvas-brick/045d9b634269eef52810e63f541134465df85fe7/index.html

It should work on desktop, with keyboard left and right arrows, or on mobile with touch events - though they tend to lead to zooming and selection.
